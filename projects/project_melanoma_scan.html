								<h2>Project Summary</h2>

								<h3>Description</h3> <!--REMEMBER TO ADD STYLESHEET LINK-->
								<p>
									The app helps to identify melanoma from images taken by iPhones. The main melanoma detection part of the app was made using
									the <a href="https://www.isic-archive.com/"><u>ISIC archive data</u></a>, and the machine learning algorithm I trained was inspired
									by the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/method/inception-v3"><u>Inception v3 convolutional neural network</u></a>.
									<br>
									<br>
									The app also has many other features, from showing local environmental cancer risks to calculating likelygenetic risks based off of the user's phenotypes
									(shown in the demo below, and briefly in the sections below).
								</p>

								<h3>App Demo</h3>
								<p>Here's a brief demo of a recent version of the app.</p>

								<h2>Project Background</h2>
								<p>
									I initially started to tackle this problem during the 2020 summer (the first of the 'covid summers').
									I had plenty of time in hand as I was stuck indoors like most people so I had decided to take a few courses to learn about how neural networks and
									machine learning really works. That involved going over the fundamental mathematics and logic behind these
									algorithms (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning"><u>this deep learning specialisation</u></a> was especially helpful).
									<br>
									<br>
									Having learnt a lot of the fundamentals behind machine learning, I wanted to do something with it. So, I
									decided to try tackle a problem, and skin cancer detection was a problem that I was drawn to the most, as I could
									use what I had just learnt to make a positive societal impact.
								</p>
								<h2>Initial Model</h2>
								<p>
									Below is the very first model I made for this problem. This is an implementation of a neural network from complete scratch. I only really used
									numpy for vector maths, but the rest of the code did not use any libraries (apart from those to help me reformat images into vectors, display graphs etc).
									In this implementation I made functions for each node, the activations etc, and then connected them together so that there was a logistic output.
									<br>
									<br>
									I do now know a lot of things I did wrong (such as wrong type of network, and a serious lack of data and computation power), but this project helped me learn those
									things. Below is a pdf showing the code I made for this (this was made in 2020, much before I made the app).
