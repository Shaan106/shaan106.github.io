                        This summer I was fortunate enough to start working with 
                        <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek/" class="link"><u>Prof Bhattacharjee</u></a>
                        at Yale designing BCI chips.
                        Specifically, I was designing a simulation tool that could model arbitrary BCI algorithms at the hardware level.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                        Something that stood out to me about the 
                        <a href="https://www.anuragkhandelwal.com/papers/scalo.pdf" class="link"><u>SCALO chip design</u></a>
                        was the idea of design chips without an ISA.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                        Simply putting a generalised solution for a specific task onto an accelerator 
                        and then creating a network of accelerators that are then optimised by some graph scheme could lead to a new way of doing computation,
                        further than just BCIs.
                    </p>

                        Some real value could be added in making algorithms lie closer to the hardware, 
                        and compute faster and more energy efficiently.

                        How does one evaluate a new design choice for a hardware system? 
                        It's unreasonable to create rtl files and write testbenches on the scale of a fully functioning x86 processor. 
                        Too much work and computation for something that could be a bad idea.

                        I recently started using simulator models for a research project, specifically <a href="https://www.gem5.org" class="link"><u>Gem5</u></a> (and simplescalar although I didn't like that as much). 
                        The ability to model entire systems and run programs like operating systems to evaluate them is essential for chip design - and it's surprisingly incomplete for something so important (at least in the public domain).

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                        Also, now this makes me curious as to what simulators for very closed and secretive architectures (ie Apple's M series chips) are like.

                        CUDA with C is very fast. Basically GPUs are very fast, but finding a way to get independent instructions that can be run in parallel is difficult and often not possible. If it was possible, no one (I think?) would use CPUs except in niche cases as GPUs are just inherintly more power efficient and faster if we can get them independent instructions.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                        I learnt how to write CUDA code for C, deal with memory allocation and transfer, how to write kernels.
                        The speedup compared to a CPU implementation of a 3 body problem I wrote was ~70x, which was very impressive.
